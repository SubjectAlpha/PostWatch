# PostWatch

---

This project will record from a USB Camera and watch for FedEx and UPS drivers delivering mail and display an alert when one is delivering.

I'm just doing this as a fun project to do something similar to video doorbells.

USPS and Amazon in the future?

This project is meant to be run on a computer with dedicated graphics (for best performance) using [opencv-python]("https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/").
